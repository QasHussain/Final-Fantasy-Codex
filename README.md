# Final Fantasy Codex

### By Qasim Hussain

## Description

Final Fantasy Codex is an online, fully responsive interactive encyclopedia of every character in the Final Fantasy series. Build in React and utlizing the [Moogle API](https://www.moogleapi.com/), this front-end application allows you to browse through every character in the series, learning their backstory, age, first appearence and much more. The user can also use the search feature to browse for specific characters by name, gender, race or game of origin. A long time fan of the series, this project was degined and created for my front-end development portfolio.

## Planning and Preperation

The inial preparation for this applicaion involved created a flowchart and moodboard in Figma. This gave me a good idea what what kind of funcionality I would need as well some visual reference for the overall look of the application.

The next step was to create a bunch of transparent PNG assets that I could use in my applicaion, as I wanted to randomly generate various Final Fnatasy cahracters as a background for the application on every refresh. Coming from an illustration and artwork background, I spend some time painting out the backgrounds on various official character posters to give me an asset sheet that would give me plenty to work with.

I then went into Figma and created a series of mock designs so I could figure out the general look, flow and fuctionality of the applicaion before I began coding. I created a mock up of the landing page and the character description page for Desktop, Ipad and Iphone. This gave me a good idea what I was aiming for when building the application.
