# Final Fantasy Codex

### By Qasim Hussain

## Description

Final Fantasy Codex is an online, fully responsive interactive encyclopedia of every character in the mainline Final Fantasy series. Built in React and utlizing the [Moogle API](https://www.moogleapi.com/), this front-end application allows you to browse through every character in the series, learning their backstory, age, first appearence and much more. The user can also use the search feature to browse for specific characters by name.

This project was degined and built for my front-end development portfolio. As a long time fan of the Final Fantasy series, I wanted to create something truly unique and personal to me.

## Planning and Preperation

The inial preparation for this applicaion involved creating a flowchart and moodboard in Figma. This gave me a good idea of the funcionality I would need as well some visual reference for the overall look of the application.

The next step was to create a series of transparent PNG assets that I could use in my applicaion, as I wanted to randomly generate various Final Fnatasy characters as a background for the application on every refresh. Coming from an illustration and artwork background, I was able to paint out the backgrounds on various official character posters and convert them to transparent PNGs. This gave me an asset sheet that would be perfect for my application.

I then went into Figma and created a series of mock designs so I could figure out the general look, flow and fuctionality of the applicaion before I began coding. I created a mock up of the landing page and the character description page for desktop, Ipad and Iphone dimentions. While i knew I wouldnt be able to re-create this exactly (the images from the API would not be tranparent PNG's like I used here) this process gave me a rough but essential visual reference as I was building and styling the application.

From here it was on to coding and building the application using the React library.
